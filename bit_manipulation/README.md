### Interesting facts

* There are builtin functions that will allow to calculate at x86 speed the number of bits *```__builtin_popcount(n)```*, count the number of trailing 0 *```__builtin_ctz(n)```* or leading 0 *```__builtin_clz(n)```* 
* *```n ^ n = 0```*
* *```(i * 0x0202020202ULL & 0x010884422010ULL) % 0x3ff```* will reverse all bits within a byte.
* Powers of Two integers only contain 1 bit as a result of *[binary numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number)*.
* *```n & 1```* tells you if the number is odd or even.
* *```n >> x```* divide a number ```n``` by ```2ˣ```, it is called *right shifting*
* *```n >> x```* multiply a number ```n``` by ```2ˣ```, it is called *left shifting*, be careful with *overflow*
