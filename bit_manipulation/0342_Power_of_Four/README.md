# [Power of Four](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-four/)

### Prototype

```cpp
bool isPowerOfFour(int n)
```

### Problem

Given an integer ```n```, return **true** if it is a power of four. Otherwise, return **false**.
An integer ```n``` is a power of four, if there exists an integer ```x``` such that ```n == 4ˣ```.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 16
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5
Output: false
```

Example 3:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
```
 

Constraints:
* ```-2³¹  <= n <= 2³¹ - 1```
