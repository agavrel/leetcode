# [Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-performing-multiplication-operations/)

### Prototype

```cpp
int maximumScore(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& M)
```

### Problem

You are given two integer arrays ```nums``` and ```multipliers``` of size ```n``` and ```m``` respectively, where ```n >= m```. The arrays are *1-indexed*.

You begin with a score of ```0```. You want to perform *exactly* m operations. On the ```iᵗʰ``` operation *(1-indexed)*, you will:

Choose one integer ```x``` from *either the start or the end* of the array ```nums```.
Add ```multipliers[i] * x``` to your score.
Remove ```x``` from the array ```nums```.

Return the *maximum* score after performing ```m``` operations.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], multipliers = [3,2,1]
Output: 14
Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the end, [1,2,3], adding 3 * 3 = 9 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [1,2], adding 2 * 2 = 4 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [1], adding 1 * 1 = 1 to the score.
The total score is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], multipliers = [-10,-5,3,4,6]
Output: 102
Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the start, [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -5 * -10 = 50 to the score.
- Choose from the start, [-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * -5 = 15 to the score.
- Choose from the start, [-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * 3 = -9 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [-2,7,1], adding 1 * 4 = 4 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [-2,7], adding 7 * 6 = 42 to the score. 
The total score is 50 + 15 - 9 + 4 + 42 = 102.
```

Constraints:
* n == nums.length
* m == multipliers.length
* 1 <= m <= 103
* m <= n <= 105
* -1000 <= nums[i], multipliers[i] <= 1000
